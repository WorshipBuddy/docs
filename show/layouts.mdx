Layouts are used to create different layouts in the same show, using the same slides. For example if you have more bridges and a break sometimes, and a shorter version another time.

# Creating a layout
By default there is just one layout. To create a new layout, select a show and go to "Show" view. Then click on the "Add layout" button at the bottom. You can click a layout to select it, or right click to rename.

# Tools
On the right side in "Show" view, you have many tools for the show and the layout.

# Layers
Drag a image or video over any slide to add to the background layer. This can be outputted and removed independently of the other layers. The second layer is the main slide layer, this shows all of the items and text on the slide. You can also drag over audio and overlays over the slides.

# Background
In the show tab, if you drag and drop a media item from the drawer it will be set as a background to the current slide you are on. Meaning if you click on the slide both the background and the slide contents will show in the output. The background will stay on until it gets cleared or another background is shown.
