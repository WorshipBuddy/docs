Go to "Connection" in the settings. Make sure the server you want to use is enabled, and click on the button of the app you want to use, e.g. "RemoteShow", you will get a popup with an IP address, that you can either manually type in any browser. Or scan the QR code.

The IP should be similar to this: 192.168.10.100:5510. It is different for each device, and the port can be changed by you, but it's not neccesary if the ports are not in use by another program.

# Troubleshooting
- Make sure the IP and port is correct.
- Make sure both the computer with PresenterBuddy and the device you want the stage display on, are connected to the same network.
- Check that the network type on the computer is set to private (not public).
- Make sure PresenterBuddy is allowed through the computer firewall.
- Check if the router port isolation settings allows local connections.
