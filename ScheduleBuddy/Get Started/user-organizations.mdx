# Managing Your Organizations

The User Organizations page is the first page you see after logging in. It shows all the organizations you belong to and allows you to access them or join new ones.

## Viewing Your Organizations

After logging in, you'll see a page listing all organizations you're a member of. Each organization card shows:

- **Organization Name**
- **Organization ID** (for sharing with others)
- **Your Role** - Whether you're an Owner, Admin, or Member

## Accessing an Organization

To access an organization's schedule and features:

1. Click on the organization card
2. You'll be taken to that organization's Dashboard
3. From there, you can navigate to Services, Teams, People, etc.

<Info>
**Tip**: You can belong to multiple organizations. Each organization maintains its own teams, services, and members.

Your role determines what you can do within each organization. See the Permissions documentation for details.
