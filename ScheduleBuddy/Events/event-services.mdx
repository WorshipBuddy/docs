# Services in Events

Events can include services (worship services, sessions, meetings, etc.) that are part of the event. These services appear in both your main Services page and within the event.

## Understanding Event Services

When you create a service within an event:

- The service is stored as part of the event
- It appears in the event's service list (on the event detail page or event dashboard)
- Event services are managed within the event context, not on the main Services page
- You can schedule teams and people for event services using the bulk scheduling interface from the event

<Info>
**Note**: Event services don't appear directly on the main Services page. They are managed and scheduled within the event's Services section or through the event dashboard.
</Info>

## Adding a Service to an Event

To add a service to an event:

1. Open your event (click on it from the Services page)
2. Go to the **Event Details** tab
3. In the **Event Services** section, click **"Add Service"**
4. Fill in the service information:
   - **Service Name** (e.g., "Opening Session", "Worship Service")
   - **Start Date and Time**
   - **End Date and Time**
   - **Location** (optional)
   - **Teams** - Select which teams are involved
5. Configure recurrence if needed (same as regular services)
6. Click **"Add Service"** or **"Save"**

The service will now appear in the event's service list and be available for scheduling through the event.

## Managing Event Services

2. Go to the **Event Details** tab
3. Find the service in the **Event Services** list

</Info>

### Removing a Service from an Event

To remove a service from an event:

1. Open the event
2. Go to the **Event Details** tab
3. Find the service you want to remove
4. Click the remove/delete button
5. Confirm removal

<Warning>
**Warning**: Removing a service from an event will also remove all team assignments for that service. The service will be removed from the event.
</Warning>

## Scheduling for Event Services

To schedule people for event services:

1. Open your event (from the Services page or event dashboard)
2. Go to the **Services** tab in the event dashboard, OR
3. Use the bulk scheduling interface accessed from the event (if available)
4. Select people for positions just like regular services
5. Save your assignments

<Info>
**Note**: Event services are scheduled through the event interface, not from the main Services page. The bulk scheduling system will filter to show only services from that event when accessed through the event context.
</Info>

## Sharing Service Schedules

You can share event service schedules publicly:

1. In the event's **Event Details** tab
2. Click **"Share Service Team Schedules"** button
3. A public link will be generated
4. Share this link so people can see who's serving at each service

<Info>
**Note**: The shared schedule shows team assignments for all services in the event. This is useful for letting attendees know who's leading worship, teaching, etc.
</Info>

## Event Service Best Practices

1. **Name clearly** - Use descriptive names like "Friday Night Worship" or "Session 1: Welcome"
2. **Set times accurately** - Include start and end times for each service
3. **Assign teams early** - Schedule teams well in advance so people can plan
4. **Use consistent locations** - If all services are in the same place, set it at the event level
5. **Link related services** - Group event services together by using clear naming conventions
