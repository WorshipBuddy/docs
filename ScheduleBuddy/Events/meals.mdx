# Meals Management

ScheduleBuddy's meals management system helps you organize meals for your events. You can create meal periods, track attendance, and manage menu planning.

## Overview

Meals management includes:
- **Meal Periods** - Create meal periods (breakfast, lunch, dinner, snacks)
- **Attendance Tracking** - Track who attended which meals
- **Menu Items** - Plan menu items for meal periods (optional)
- **Export** - Export meal attendance data

## Setting Up Meals

Meals are managed at the event level. To set up meals for an event:

1. Open your event
2. Go to the **Meals** tab in the event dashboard
3. Start by creating meal periods

## Meal Periods

Meal periods represent individual meal times during your event (breakfast, lunch, dinner, snacks, etc.).

### Creating a Meal Period

1. In the Meals tab, click **"+ Add Meal Period"** or go to the Meal Periods section
2. Fill in the meal period details:

   **Basic Information:**
   - **Name** - Meal name (e.g., "Breakfast", "Lunch", "Dinner", "Welcome Dinner")
   - **Date** - Date of the meal (ISO date, YYYY-MM-DD format)
   - **Start Time** - When the meal service begins (ISO time, HH:MM format)
   - **End Time** - When the meal service ends (ISO time, HH:MM format)
   - **Location** - Where the meal is served (optional, can be different from event location)

   **Capacity & Tracking:**
   - **Capacity** - Maximum number of attendees (optional)
   - **Allow Multiple Attendance** - Whether the same meal can be attended multiple times on different days (default: false)

   **Additional:**
   - **Kitchen Notes** - Private notes for kitchen staff (optional, not visible to registrants)

3. Click **"Save"** to create the meal period

### Editing a Meal Period

4. Click **"Save"** to update

### Deleting a Meal Period

2. Click the delete icon (trash) on the meal period card

</Warning>

## Tracking Attendance

You can track which registrants attended which meals.

### Recording Attendance

1. In the Meals tab, go to the Attendance section
2. Find the meal period you want to record attendance for
3. Click **"Record Attendance"** or **"Mark Attendance"**
4. Select registrants who attended the meal:
   - You can select by registration_id and registrant_email
   - The system identifies registrants by their email address
5. Set attendance status:
   - **Attended** - Mark as true if they attended, false if they didn't
   - **Attended At** - Timestamp of when they attended (ISO datetime)
   - **Attended By** - Email of the staff member who marked the attendance
6. Optionally add:
   - **Dietary Restrictions** - Dietary restrictions or allergies (from registration answers)
   - **Special Requests** - Special meal requests beyond allergies
7. Click **"Save"** to record attendance

### Attendance Details

Each attendance record includes:
- **Registration ID** - Reference to the event registration
- **Registrant Email** - Email of the registrant (used to identify them)
- **Meal Period ID** - Reference to the meal period
- **Attended** - Whether they actually attended (boolean)
- **Attended At** - Timestamp of attendance (ISO datetime)
- **Attended By** - Email of user/staff who marked attendance
- **Dietary Restrictions** - List of dietary restrictions
- **Special Requests** - Special meal requests

### Updating Attendance

1. Find the attendance record in the Attendance list
2. Click the edit icon
3. Update the attendance status or other fields
4. Click **"Save"** to update

<Info>
**Note**: If you record attendance for the same registrant and meal period again, the system will update the existing record rather than creating a duplicate.
</Info>

### Multiple Attendance

If "Allow Multiple Attendance" is enabled for a meal period:
- The same meal can be attended multiple times on different dates
- Each attendance is tracked separately by date
- Useful for meals that repeat daily (e.g., breakfast each day of a multi-day event)

## Menu Planning (Optional)

You can optionally plan menu items for meal periods.

### Menu Items

Menu items represent food items that will be served during a meal period.

1. Go to the Meals tab
2. Find a meal period
3. Click **"Menu Items"** or **"Plan Menu"**
4. Add menu items:
   - **Name** - Name of the menu item
   - **Description** - Description of the item (optional)
   - **Dietary Tags** - Tags like "vegetarian", "gluten-free", "vegan", "dairy-free", etc.
5. Save the menu items

Menu items help with:
- Planning what to serve
- Communicating menu to registrants
- Tracking dietary accommodations

## Exporting Meal Data

You can export meal attendance data for reporting or coordination with kitchen staff.

### Meals Export

1. Go to the Meals tab
2. Click **"Export"** or **"Export Attendance"**
3. Choose export format (CSV, Excel)
4. The export includes:
   - All meal periods
   - All attendance records
   - Registrant information
   - Attendance status and timestamps
   - Dietary restrictions and special requests

## Best Practices

1. **Create meal periods early** - Set up all meal periods before the event
2. **Use clear names** - Name meals descriptively (e.g., "Welcome Dinner - Day 1", "Breakfast - Day 2")
3. **Set accurate times** - Use start and end times to help coordinate service
4. **Track capacity** - Set capacity limits to help kitchen staff plan
5. **Record attendance promptly** - Mark attendance during or immediately after meals for accuracy
6. **Document dietary restrictions** - Track dietary restrictions to ensure accommodations are met
7. **Use kitchen notes** - Add private notes for kitchen staff about special requirements
8. **Enable multiple attendance** - For multi-day events with repeated meals, enable multiple attendance
9. **Export regularly** - Export attendance data for backup and reporting
10. **Coordinate with kitchen** - Share exported data with kitchen staff for meal planning

## Troubleshooting

**Can't record attendance:**
- Verify the registrant is registered for the event
- Check that the registrant_email matches the registration
- Ensure the meal period exists and is active

**Attendance not saving:**
- The system updates existing records if attendance is recorded again for the same registrant and meal period
- Check that registration_id and registrant_email are correct
- Verify the meal_period_id exists

**Duplicate attendance records:**
- The system prevents duplicates by checking registration_id, registrant_email, and meal_period_id
- If you see duplicates, one may have incorrect data

**Menu items not showing:**
- Menu items are optional and separate from attendance tracking
- Ensure you're viewing the correct meal period
- Check that menu items have been created for that meal period
