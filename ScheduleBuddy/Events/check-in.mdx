# Check-In System

ScheduleBuddy's check-in system uses QR codes to quickly and securely check in registrants at your events. QR codes are automatically generated and sent in registration confirmation emails.

## Overview

The check-in system includes:
- **QR Code Generation** - Automatic QR code generation for each registrant
- **QR Code Verification** - Secure verification using hash-based validation
- **Registration Scanner** - Web-based scanner for checking in registrants
- **Check-In Logs** - Complete log of all check-ins
- **Export** - Export check-in data for reporting

## How QR Codes Work

When a registrant registers for your event, a unique QR code is automatically generated and included in their confirmation email. Each QR code contains:
- Event ID
- Registration ID
- Registrant ID (required for unique identification)
- Registrant name and email
- Verification hash for security

### QR Code Security

QR codes include a verification hash that ensures:
- The QR code hasn't been tampered with
- The QR code is valid for this specific event
- The registrant information matches the registration

The verification hash is calculated using:
- Event ID
- Registration ID
- Registrant ID
- First name
- Last name
- Email
- Event start date

### QR Code Format

QR codes are generated as images embedded in confirmation emails. Registrants can:
- View the QR code on their phone
- Print the QR code and bring it to the event
- Present the QR code at check-in

## Enabling QR Code Scanning

QR code scanning is enabled by default for events. It can be configured in the event's check-in settings:

1. Open your event
2. Go to **Event Settings** → **Check-In Settings**
3. Ensure **"QR Scan"** is enabled in check-in methods
4. Save the settings

<Info>
**Note**: If QR scan is not enabled, QR codes will still be generated in confirmation emails, but the scanner won't be available for check-in.
</Info>

## Registration Scanner

The Registration Scanner is a web-based tool for checking in registrants using their QR codes.

### Accessing the Scanner

1. Navigate to `/registration-scanner/?org={org_id}&event={event_id}`
2. The scanner will load with two modes:
   - **QR Scan Mode** - Scan QR codes using your device's camera
   - **Manual Entry Mode** - Manually enter registrant information

### Using QR Scan Mode

1. Click **"QR Scan"** mode
2. Allow camera permissions when prompted
3. Point your device's camera at the registrant's QR code
4. The scanner will automatically:
   - Detect and read the QR code
   - Verify the QR code's validity
   - Check if the registrant is already checked in
   - Check in the registrant if valid and not already checked in
5. You'll see a confirmation message with registrant information

### Using Manual Entry Mode

If QR scanning isn't available or you need to check someone in manually:

1. Click **"Manual Entry"** mode
2. Enter the registrant's email address
3. Click **"Check In"**
4. The system will find the registrant and check them in

### Scanner Features

The registration scanner includes:
- **Station ID** - Optional field to identify which check-in station is being used
- **Scanner Name** - Required field to identify who is performing the check-in
- **Check-In Confirmation** - Shows registrant name and confirmation message
- **Already Checked In** - Indicates if someone has already been checked in
- **Check-In Log** - View recently checked-in registrants

<Info>
**Tip**: The scanner works best on mobile devices with cameras. For desktop use, you can still use manual entry mode.
</Info>

## Check-In Process

When a QR code is scanned or a registrant is manually checked in:

1. **Verification** - The system verifies:
   - The QR code is valid (hash verification)
   - The registrant exists in the event registrations
   - The registrant_id is present (required)
   - The event matches

2. **Duplicate Check** - The system checks if the registrant is already checked in:
   - If already checked in, it returns "Already checked in" with the check-in timestamp
   - If not checked in, it proceeds to create a check-in log

3. **Check-In Log Creation** - A check-in log entry is created with:
   - Event ID
   - Registration ID
   - Registrant ID (required for unique identification)
   - First name and last name
   - Station ID (if provided)
   - Checked in by (scanner name)
   - Check-in type: "arrival"
   - Method: "qr_scan" or "manual"
   - Check-in timestamp (ISO datetime)
   - Checked out: false (initial state)

4. **Confirmation** - A success message is returned with:
   - Check-in confirmation
   - Registrant ID
   - Check-in timestamp

## Check-In Logs

All check-ins are logged in the event's check-in logs. Each log entry includes:
- **Event ID** - Reference to the event
- **Registration ID** - Reference to the registration
- **Registrant ID** - Unique identifier for the registrant (required)
- **First Name / Last Name** - Registrant's name
- **Station ID** - Optional check-in station identifier
- **Checked In By** - Email or name of person who checked them in
- **Check-In Type** - Type of check-in (currently "arrival")
- **Method** - How they were checked in ("qr_scan" or "manual")
- **Checked In At** - Timestamp of check-in (ISO datetime)
- **Checked Out** - Whether they have been checked out (boolean)
- **Checked Out At** - Timestamp of check-out (if applicable)

### Viewing Check-In Logs

To view check-in logs:
1. Open your event
2. Go to the **Check-In** tab in the event dashboard
3. View the list of check-ins with:
   - Registrant information
   - Check-in time
   - Station and scanner information
   - Check-out status

## Check-Out

The check-in system supports checking out registrants as well. To check someone out:
1. Find the registrant in the check-in logs
2. Click **"Check Out"** or use the checkout feature
3. The system will update the check-in log with:
   - Checked out: true
   - Checked out at: timestamp

<Info>
**Note**: Check-out functionality may vary depending on your event configuration. Some events may only track check-in, while others track both check-in and check-out.
</Info>

## Exporting Check-In Data

You can export check-in data for reporting or analysis.

### Check-In Export

1. Go to the Check-In tab in your event dashboard
2. Click **"Export"** or **"Export Check-In Data"**
3. Choose export format (CSV, Excel)
4. The export includes:
   - All check-in log entries
   - Registrant information
   - Check-in timestamps
   - Station and scanner information
   - Check-out status
   - Registration details

## Best Practices

1. **Test the scanner** - Before the event, test the registration scanner to ensure it works on your devices
2. **Train staff** - Make sure check-in staff know how to use the scanner
3. **Have backup** - Keep manual entry as a backup if QR scanning fails
4. **Monitor check-ins** - Regularly check the check-in logs during the event
5. **Use stations** - Use station IDs to track which check-in points are busiest
6. **Print backup** - Have registrants print QR codes as backup in case phones die
7. **Secure scanner access** - Only give scanner access to trusted staff
8. **Export regularly** - Export check-in data periodically as backup
9. **Check duplicates** - The system prevents duplicate check-ins, but monitor for any issues
10. **Verify QR codes** - Ensure QR codes are clear and not damaged when scanning

## Troubleshooting

**QR code not scanning:**
- Ensure camera permissions are granted
- Make sure the QR code is clear and well-lit
- Try manual entry mode as a backup
- Verify the QR code hasn't been damaged

**"Invalid QR code" error:**
- The QR code may be for a different event
- The QR code may have been tampered with
- The registrant may have been removed from the event

**"Registrant not found" error:**
- Verify the registrant is registered for the event
- Check that the registrant_id is present (required)
- Ensure the registration is active

**"Already checked in" message:**
- The registrant has already been checked in
- The system shows when they were checked in
- If this is an error, you can check them out and check them in again

**Scanner not working on mobile:**
- Ensure you're using a modern browser with camera support
- Grant camera permissions when prompted
- Try refreshing the page
- Use manual entry mode as a backup

**Check-in not saving:**
- Verify you have proper permissions for the event
- Check your internet connection
- Ensure the event is active
- Try refreshing and checking in again
