# Registration Responses

Once people start registering for your event, you can view, manage, and export their responses through the Registration Responses tab.

## Viewing Responses

To view registration responses:

1. Open your event
2. Click the **"Registration Responses"** tab
3. You'll see a list of all registrations

## Response Information

For each registration, you'll see:

- **Registrant Information** - Name, email, and contact details
- **Responses** - Answers to all registration form questions
- **Registration Date** - When they registered
- **Edit Link** - Link to allow the registrant to edit their response (if editing is enabled)

## Editing Responses

If you've enabled "Allow editing responses" in your registration form settings:

1. Registrants receive a confirmation email with an edit link
2. They can click the link to update their information
3. They can also cancel their registration through the edit link

<Info>
**Note**: You (as an admin) can also view responses but cannot edit them directly. Registrants must use their edit link to make changes.
</Info>

## Exporting Responses

You can export all registration responses to a CSV file:

1. Go to the **Registration Responses** tab
2. Click **"Export to CSV"** or similar export button
3. The CSV file will download with:
   - Each question as a separate column
   - Each registration as a row
   - All response data included

<Info>
**Tip**: CSV export is great for:
- Creating mailing lists
- Analyzing registration data
- Importing into other systems (email marketing, spreadsheet analysis, etc.)
- Sharing registration lists with team members
</Info>

## Filtering and Searching

You can filter or search responses by:

- **Name** - Find specific registrants
- **Email** - Search by email address
- **Question responses** - Filter by answers to specific questions
- **Registration date** - Find registrations within a date range

<Info>
**Note**: Filtering options may vary depending on your event's registration form configuration.
</Info>

## Anonymous Submissions

If you've enabled anonymous submissions:

- Some registrations may not include name/email
- These appear in your response list but with limited identifying information
- You can still see their question responses

<Warning>
**Privacy Note**: Be careful when sharing exported CSV files. They contain personal information that should be handled according to your organization's privacy policy.
</Warning>

## Registration Statistics

You may see statistics such as:

- Total number of registrations
- Registration trends over time
- Response counts for specific questions
- Other summary information

## Managing Multiple Registrations

If "Allow multiple registrations" is enabled:

- People can register multiple times (for registering family members, etc.)
- Each registration appears as a separate entry
- You can see which registrations are from the same person (by email)

## Best Practices

1. **Export regularly** - Create backups of your registration data
2. **Review responses** - Check for any issues or incomplete information
3. **Communicate with registrants** - Use exported emails to send event updates
4. **Respect privacy** - Handle personal information according to your privacy policy
5. **Verify information** - Check that critical information (dietary needs, transportation, etc.) is accurate
