# Events Overview

Events in ScheduleBuddy allow you to organize special gatherings, conferences, retreats, workshops, and other multi-day activities separate from your regular services. Events provide specialized tools for managing registration, logistics, and coordination.

## What are Events?

Events are separate from regular services and provide:

- **Event-specific organization** - Keep event planning separate from regular service scheduling
- **Registration forms** - Collect information from attendees with custom questions
- **Event services** - Schedule services within events (managed within the event context)
- **Logistics management** - Manage transportation, housing, meals, and check-in for events
- **Public access** - Share registration links publicly or keep events private

## Event vs. Service

Understanding the difference:

- **Services** - Regular recurring or one-time gatherings (Sunday service, Bible study, etc.)
- **Events** - Special multi-day or complex gatherings that need registration and logistics coordination (conference, retreat, workshop, etc.)

Services within events are managed within the event context:
- They appear in the event's service list
- They're scheduled through the event's scheduling interface
- They're separate from regular services on the main Services page

This approach keeps event services organized within their event while maintaining clear separation from regular service scheduling.
