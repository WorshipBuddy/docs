# Creating and Managing Events

Events allow you to organize special gatherings like conferences, retreats, workshops, and other multi-day activities with registration and logistics management.

## Creating an Event

To create a new event:

1. Go to the **Services** page
2. Click the **"Add Event"** button (visible to Owners and Organization Admins)
3. Choose an event template (optional):
   - **Blank Event** - Start from scratch with no pre-configured settings
   - **Conference** - Multi-day event with sessions (good for conferences)
   - **Retreat** - Housing and meals enabled (good for retreats)
   - **Workshop** - Single day event setup
4. Fill in the event information:
   - **Event Name** (required) - Name of your event
   - **Start Date** (required) - When the event begins
   - **End Date** (required) - When the event ends
   - **Location** (optional) - Where the event takes place
5. Click **"Create Event"**

<Info>
**Tip**: Templates provide a good starting point with common settings pre-configured. You can always modify settings after creating the event.
</Info>

## Event Details

After creating an event, you can edit its details:

1. Click on the event from the Services page (events appear alongside services)
2. Or go to the event detail page
3. In the **Event Details** tab, you can modify:
   - **Event Name**
   - **Location**
   - **Start Date and Time**
   - **End Date and Time**

### Event Status

Events can have different statuses:

- **Draft** - Event is still being set up, not visible for registration
- **Published** - Event is live and registration is open (if configured) - **This is the default status when creating an event**
- **Active** - Event is currently happening
- **Completed** - Event has finished
- **Archived** - Event is over and archived for historical reference

<Info>
**Note**: Events are created with "Published" status by default. Only published events can accept registrations. Draft events are visible to admins for setup but not to the public.
</Info>

### Event Visibility

Events can be:

- **Private** - Only visible to organization members
- **Public** - Can be shared with registration links

<Info>
**Tip**: Use public visibility when you want to share registration links with people outside your organization.
</Info>

## Editing Event Details

To edit an event:

1. Go to the **Services** page
2. Click on the event card
3. Go to the **Event Details** tab
4. Make your changes
5. Click **"Save Changes"**

## Deleting an Event

To delete an event:

1. Open the event details
2. Click the **"Delete Event"** button (usually red/destructive styling)
3. Confirm the deletion

<Warning>
**Warning**: Deleting an event cannot be undone. This will remove:
- The event
- All registration responses
- All event services
- All logistics data (transportation, housing, meals, etc.)

Make sure you want to permanently delete the event before confirming.
</Warning>

## Event Templates Explained

### Blank Event
- No pre-configured settings
- Start completely from scratch
- Good for custom events

### Conference Template
- Pre-configures: Housing, Transportation, and Meals assistance enabled
- Good for multi-day conferences with sessions
- Automatically enables logistics features for coordinating attendees

### Retreat Template
- Pre-configures: Housing and Meals assistance enabled (Transportation disabled)
- Good for multi-day overnight retreats
- Focuses on accommodation and meal planning

### Workshop Template
- Pre-configures: No additional services enabled (all disabled)
- Good for single-day workshops or seminars
- Minimal setup - just registration and services

<Info>
**Tip**: Template settings are applied after event creation. You can always change these settings (enable/disable housing, meals, transportation) in the registration form settings after creating the event, regardless of which template you chose.
</Info>

## Best Practices

1. **Plan ahead** - Create events early to allow time for registration and logistics setup
2. **Use templates** - Start with a template that matches your event type to get the right features pre-enabled
3. **Set dates carefully** - Ensure start and end dates are correct
4. **Change status if needed** - Events are created as "Published" by default - change to "Draft" if you want to finish setup before making registration available
5. **Use public visibility** - For events open to people outside your organization
