ScheduleBuddy's housing management system helps you coordinate accommodations for your events. You can create housing locations, assign guests to hosts, track occupancy, and provide host dashboards.

## Overview

Housing is managed at the event level. To set up housing for an event:

1. Open your event
2. Go to the **Housing** tab in the event dashboard
3. Start by creating housing locations, then assign guests

## Housing Locations

Housing locations represent places where guests can stay (houses, rooms, dormitories, etc.).

### Occupancy Tracking

The system automatically tracks current occupancy for each location:

## Assigning Guests

You can assign registrants (guests) to housing locations.

### Individual Assignment

2. Click **"+ Assign Housing"** or find a registrant
3. Select the registrant(s):
   - You can select a single registrant or multiple registrants from the same registration

   - **Party Together** - Whether to group registrants by their registration (default: true)
   - Check-in/check-out dates
   - Special needs

## Host Dashboard

Hosts can access a special dashboard to view their assigned guests and location information.

### Accessing the Host Dashboard

1. Navigate to `/host-dashboard/?org={org_id}&event={event_id}&location={location_id}`
2. The dashboard will show:
   - Location information (name, address, capacity, current occupancy)
   - List of assigned guests
   - Guest contact information (if shared with host)
   - Check-in/check-out dates
   - Special needs and notes

<Info>
**Tip**: Share the host dashboard URL with hosts so they can view their assigned guests and location details on their mobile devices.
</Info>

### Host Information Sharing

When creating a housing location, you can control what information is shared with the host:
- **Share with Host** - Enable to share guest information with the host
- If enabled, hosts can see guest names, contact information, check-in dates, and special needs
- If disabled, hosts will only see location information, not guest details

## Exporting Housing Data

You can export housing assignments for reporting or coordination.

### Housing Export

1. Go to the Housing tab
2. Click **"Export"** or **"Export Data"**
3. Choose export format (CSV, Excel)
4. The export includes:
   - All housing locations
   - All assignments
   - Guest information
   - Location details
   - Occupancy information
   - Check-in/check-out dates

## Best Practices

1. **Create locations early** - Set up housing locations before registration opens
2. **Set accurate capacity** - Include all beds/spaces available at each location
3. **Use descriptive names** - Name locations clearly (e.g., "Smith House - Main Floor")
4. **Set check-in/check-out dates** - Help coordinate timing with hosts
5. **Track special needs** - Document accessibility requirements or special accommodations
6. **Share host dashboards** - Give hosts access to their dashboards for guest information
7. **Monitor occupancy** - Regularly check occupancy to avoid overbooking
8. **Use bulk assignment** - Save time by assigning multiple guests to the same location
9. **Document amenities** - List amenities to help match guests to suitable locations
10. **Export regularly** - Export housing data as backup before the event

## Troubleshooting

**Location capacity exceeded:**
- Check current occupancy vs capacity
- Some locations may have an overbook limit set
- Consider creating additional locations or adjusting assignments

**Can't assign guest:**
- Verify the guest is registered for the event
- Check that the location has available capacity
- Ensure the location exists and is active

**Occupancy not updating:**
- The system recalculates occupancy automatically when assignments change
- Refresh the page to see updated occupancy
- Verify assignments are using valid location_id and registrant_ids

**Host dashboard not showing guests:**
- Check that "Share with Host" is enabled on the location
- Verify guests are assigned to that location
- Ensure the location_id in the URL is correct
