# Public Event Registration

People can register for your event using the public registration link. This page explains how the registration process works from the registrant's perspective.

## Finding the Registration Link

Event administrators share the registration link via:
- Email
- Website
- Social media
- Direct message

The link looks something like:
```
https://schedule.worshipbuddy.org/event-register/?org=YOUR_ORG_ID&event=EVENT_ID
```

## Registration Process

### Step 1: Access the Form

1. Click the registration link shared by the event organizer
2. The registration form will load
3. You'll see the event name, dates, and location at the top

<Info>
**Note**: If registration hasn't opened yet or has closed, you'll see a message indicating when registration is available.
</Info>

### Step 2: Fill Out the Form

1. Enter your information as requested:
   - **Name** (first and last)
   - **Email address**
   - **Other contact information** (if requested)
2. Answer all required questions (marked with *)
3. Answer optional questions as desired
4. If the event includes additional services, you may see tabs for:
   - Housing assistance
   - Transportation assistance
   - Meals assistance

### Step 3: Submit Registration

1. Review your answers
2. Click **"Submit Registration"** or **"Register"**
3. You'll see a confirmation message
4. You'll receive a confirmation email with:
   - Your registration details
   - An edit link (if editing is enabled)
   - Event information

## Editing Your Registration

If the event allows editing responses:

1. Check your email for the confirmation message
2. Click the **"Edit Registration"** link in the email
3. Make your changes
4. Submit the updated registration

You can also:
- **Cancel your registration** through the edit link
- **Update your information** if something changes
- **Add additional registrations** if multiple registrations are allowed

<Info>
**Tip**: Keep your confirmation email! It contains the link you need to edit or cancel your registration.
</Info>

## Registration Dates

The registration form respects registration dates set by the event organizer:

- **Before Registration Opens** - You'll see a message indicating when registration opens
- **During Registration Period** - You can register normally
- **After Registration Closes** - You'll see a message that registration is closed

<Info>
**Note**: If registration has a "soft close" date, you'll see the deadline on the form, but you may still be able to register until the "hard close" date.
</Info>

## Question Types

You may encounter different types of questions:

### Text Questions
- Short answer text fields
- Long answer text areas
- Email and phone number fields
- Address fields

### Selection Questions
- Dropdown menus - Select one option
- Multiple choice - Select one option from a list
- Checkboxes - Select multiple options

### Date and Time
- Date pickers
- Time pickers

### Numbers and Ratings
- Number inputs
- Rating scales (e.g., 1-5 stars)
- Numeric scales with labels

<Info>
**Tip**: Required questions are marked with an asterisk (*). Make sure to answer all required questions to complete your registration.
</Info>

## Conditional Questions

Some questions may appear based on your previous answers:

- If you answer "Yes" to one question, additional questions may appear
- If you answer "No", those questions may be hidden
- This helps keep the form relevant and shorter

## Multiple Registrations

If the event allows multiple registrations:

- You can register yourself
- You can register family members or others
- Each registration is separate
- You'll receive a confirmation email for each registration

<Info>
**Note**: Use multiple registrations to register people who don't have email addresses or who asked you to register for them.
</Info>

- Check that the link is correct
- Verify that registration is currently open
