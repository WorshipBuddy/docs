# Transportation Management

ScheduleBuddy's transportation management system helps you coordinate ground transportation for your events. You can manage vehicles, drivers, routes, assign passengers, track flights, and use QR code scanning for check-in.

## Overview

Transportation management includes:
- **Vehicles** - Manage vehicles available for transportation
- **Drivers** - Manage drivers who operate vehicles
- **Routes** - Create pickup routes with multiple stops
- **Assignments** - Assign registrants to routes or mark them as self-driving
- **Flight Tracking** - Track flights and integrate them with routes
- **QR Tickets** - Generate QR codes for route check-in
- **Dashboards** - Driver and flight dashboards for real-time tracking

## Setting Up Transportation

Transportation is managed at the event level. To set up transportation for an event:

1. Open your event
2. Go to the **Transportation** tab in the event dashboard
3. Start by creating vehicles and drivers, then create routes

## Vehicles

Vehicles represent the physical vehicles used for transportation (buses, shuttles, vans, cars, etc.).

### Creating a Vehicle

1. In the Transportation tab, click **"+ Add Vehicle"** or go to the Vehicles section
2. Fill in the vehicle details:
   - **Name** - Vehicle identifier (e.g., "Bus 1", "Shuttle Van A")
   - **Vehicle Type** - Type of vehicle (bus, shuttle, van, car, etc.)
   - **Capacity** - Maximum number of passengers (includes the driver)
   - **Checked Bag Capacity** - Maximum number of checked bags
   - **Carry-On Bag Capacity** - Maximum number of carry-on bags
   - **License Plate** - Vehicle license plate number (optional)
   - **Notes** - Additional notes about the vehicle (optional)
3. Click **"Save"** to create the vehicle

### Editing a Vehicle

1. Find the vehicle in the Vehicles list
2. Click the edit icon (pencil) on the vehicle card
3. Update the fields you want to change
4. Click **"Save"** to update

<Warning>
**Note**: You cannot delete a vehicle if it's assigned to any active routes. You'll need to remove it from all routes first or delete the routes.
</Warning>

### Vehicle Capacity

Vehicle capacity includes the driver. For example, if a bus has a capacity of 40, it can hold 39 passengers plus 1 driver. When assigning passengers to routes that use this vehicle, the system will track capacity to prevent overbooking.

## Drivers

Drivers are people who operate vehicles for transportation.

### Creating a Driver

1. In the Transportation tab, go to the Drivers section
2. Click **"+ Add Driver"**
3. Fill in the driver details:
   - **Name** - Driver's full name
   - **Email** - Driver's email address (optional, for notifications)
   - **Phone** - Driver's phone number (optional)
   - **Vehicle** - Optionally link this driver to a specific vehicle
   - **Notes** - Additional notes (optional)
4. Click **"Save"** to create the driver

### Driver Dashboard

Drivers can access a special dashboard to view their assigned routes and passengers. The driver dashboard shows:
- All routes assigned to the driver
- Passenger list for each route
- Pickup locations and times
- Check-in status for each passenger
- Route details (origin, dropoff location, departure/arrival times)

To access the driver dashboard:
1. Navigate to `/driver-dashboard/?org={org_id}&event={event_id}&driver={driver_id}`
2. The dashboard will show all routes for that driver

<Info>
**Tip**: You can share the driver dashboard URL with drivers so they can view their routes and passengers on their mobile devices.

<Info>
**Note**: Flight status updates use the OpenSky Network API, which only tracks flights currently in the air or recently tracked. Scheduled or completed flights may not have real-time data available.
</Info>

## QR Tickets for Routes

Routes can generate QR tickets that passengers can use for check-in.

### Enabling QR Tickets

When creating or editing a route:
1. Find the **"QR Tickets"** section
2. Enable **"Send QR Tickets"**
3. Save the route

When QR tickets are enabled:
- QR tickets are generated for each passenger assigned to the route
- Tickets are sent via email when you send route notifications
- Passengers can present their QR code for check-in

### QR Ticket Check-In

Passengers present their QR code at transportation check-in:
1. Use the Transportation Scanner (see Transportation Scanner below)
2. Select the route
3. Scan the passenger's QR code
4. The system verifies the QR code and checks them in

QR tickets include:
- Route information
- Passenger information
- Verification hash for security

## Transportation Scanner

The transportation scanner is used to check in passengers for routes using QR codes.

### Using the Transportation Scanner

1. Navigate to `/transportation-scanner/?org={org_id}&event={event_id}`
2. Select the route you want to check passengers in for
3. Scan QR codes using your device's camera
4. The system will:
   - Verify the QR code
   - Check if the passenger is assigned to the selected route
   - Mark them as checked in
   - Show confirmation

### Scanner Features

- Route selection dropdown
- Camera-based QR code scanning
- Real-time verification
- Check-in confirmation
- List of checked-in passengers

<Info>
**Tip**: The transportation scanner works best on mobile devices with cameras. Make sure passengers have their QR tickets ready (on their phone or printed).
</Info>

## Notifications

You can send notifications to transportation providers and passengers.

### Route Notifications

To send notifications to all passengers on a route:
1. Find the route in the Routes list
2. Click **"Send Notifications"** or **"Notify Passengers"**
3. The system will send emails to all assigned passengers with:
   - Route details
   - Pickup locations and times
   - Driver information
   - QR tickets (if enabled)

### Provider Notifications

For transportation providers (drivers):
- Driver arrival notifications
- Delay notifications
- Late arrival notifications

These notifications can be configured in the route settings or sent manually.

## Exports

You can export transportation data for reporting or coordination:

### Transportation Export

1. Go to the Transportation tab
2. Click **"Export"** or **"Export Data"**
3. Choose export format (CSV, Excel)
4. The export includes:
   - All routes
   - All assignments
   - Passenger information
   - Vehicle and driver assignments
   - Check-in status

## Best Practices

1. **Plan ahead** - Create vehicles and drivers before creating routes
2. **Use descriptive route names** - Include time and destination (e.g., "Airport Shuttle - 3pm Pickup")
3. **Set accurate capacity** - Include driver in capacity calculations
4. **Track flights** - Add flight information for airport pickups to coordinate timing
5. **Use QR tickets** - Enable QR tickets for faster check-in on event day
6. **Test the scanner** - Before the event, test the transportation scanner to ensure it works
7. **Share driver dashboards** - Give drivers access to their dashboards so they can see passenger lists
8. **Monitor capacity** - Regularly check route capacity to avoid overbooking
9. **Send notifications early** - Notify passengers about their routes well in advance
10. **Export data** - Export transportation data as backup before the event

## Troubleshooting

**Can't delete a vehicle:**
- The vehicle is assigned to one or more routes
- Remove the vehicle from all routes first, or delete the routes

**Can't assign passenger to route:**
- Check if the route is at capacity
- Verify the route exists and is active
- Make sure the registrant is registered for the event

**QR code not scanning:**
- Ensure QR code scanning is enabled for the event
- Verify the QR code is for the correct route
- Check that the passenger is assigned to the selected route

**Flight status not updating:**
- OpenSky Network only tracks flights currently in the air
- Scheduled or completed flights may not have real-time data
- Check that the flight number is correct

**Driver dashboard not showing routes:**
- Verify the driver is assigned to routes
- Check that the driver_id in the URL is correct
- Ensure the event has active routes
