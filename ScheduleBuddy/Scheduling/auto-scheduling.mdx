# Auto-Scheduling

Auto-Scheduling allows you to automatically assign team members to multiple services at once. This saves time when scheduling recurring services or when you need to fill many positions across multiple dates.

## Accessing Auto-Scheduling

1. Go to the **Services** page
2. Click the **"Auto Schedule"** button (visible if you have scheduling permissions)

## How Auto-Scheduling Works

The auto-scheduling feature intelligently assigns people to positions based on:
- Their assigned positions
- Their availability (unavailability dates)
- Existing assignments (to avoid over-scheduling)
- Position quantity requirements

## Step 1: Choose Scope

You can auto-schedule for either:

### Date Range
- Select a **Start Date** and **End Date**
- All services within this date range will be included
- Leave dates blank to include all upcoming services

### Specific Services
- Pick individual services from a list
- More control over exactly which services to schedule
- Use "Select all" or "Clear" buttons for quick selection

## Step 2: Select Teams

After choosing your scope:

1. A list of teams will appear
2. Select which teams you want to auto-schedule
   - You'll only see teams you have permission to schedule
   - Use "Select all" to choose all teams
   - Use "Clear" to deselect all teams
3. Click **"Continue"**

## Running Auto-Scheduling

After selecting teams:

1. The system will analyze all the services and teams you selected
2. It will automatically assign people to positions where they:
   - Have the required position
   - Are available (not marked unavailable)
   - Don't have conflicting assignments
3. A confirmation message will appear when complete
4. Review the assignments in the Services page

<Info>
**Note**: Auto-scheduling may not fill every position if there aren't enough available people with the required positions. You can manually fill remaining positions after auto-scheduling runs.
</Info>

## Tips for Best Results

- **Check availability first** - Make sure people have marked their unavailability dates
- **Verify positions** - Ensure people are assigned to the correct positions for each team
- **Review after running** - Always review auto-assignments and make manual adjustments as needed
- **Use date ranges carefully** - Start with a small date range to test, then expand if needed

## Manual Adjustments

After auto-scheduling runs:

1. Go to the Services page
2. Review the assignments that were made
3. Make any manual adjustments needed
4. The system will show warnings if there are conflicts

<Info>
**Tip**: Auto-scheduling is a great starting point, but you may want to review and adjust assignments to account for special circumstances, preferences, or balance workloads.
