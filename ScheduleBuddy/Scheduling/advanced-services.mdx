# Advanced Service Management

Beyond creating services, you can edit, delete, and manage existing services in various ways.

## Editing a Service

To edit an existing service:

1. Go to the **Services** page
2. Click on the service card you want to edit
3. A popup will appear with the service details
4. Make your changes:
   - **Service Name**
   - **Location**
   - **Start Date and Time**
   - **End Date and Time**
   - **Teams** assigned to the service
5. Click **"Update Service"** to save your changes

<Info>
**Note**: Only Owners and Organization Admins can edit services. Team Admins and Schedulers can schedule people but cannot edit service details.
</Info>

## Deleting a Service

To delete a service:

1. Open the service for editing
2. Click the **"Delete"** button (usually red/destructive styling)
3. Confirm the deletion

<Warning>
**Warning**: Deleting a service cannot be undone. All assignments for that service will be removed. Make sure you want to permanently delete the service before confirming.
</Warning>

## Viewing Availability for a Service

When scheduling a service, availability information is shown directly in the selection area:

1. Open a service for scheduling (either through bulk scheduling or service-specific scheduling)
2. When you click to select a person for a position, the dropdown will show:
   - **Available** - People who can serve (no highlighting)
   - **Unavailable** - Highlighted in yellow if they've marked this date as unavailable
   - **Fatigue** - Highlighted in blue shades if they've been scheduled frequently recently
   - **Conflicts** - Highlighted in red if they have scheduling conflicts
3. Each person's status is indicated by color highlighting and status text
4. People are automatically sorted with available people first, making it easy to choose from people without issues

<Info>
**Tip**: The availability information is integrated into the selection process, so you can see who's available right when you're choosing who to schedule. No need to check a separate view - it's all right there in the dropdown.
</Info>

## Service Status Indicators

Services show different visual indicators:

- **Next Upcoming Service** - Highlighted with a green border to show it's the next one
- **Upcoming Services** - Normal display
- **Past Services** - Dimmed/faded to show they've already occurred

## Removing Team Assignments

To remove a team from a service:

1. Open the service for editing
2. Find the team you want to remove
3. Click the remove/delete button for that team
4. Click **"Update Service"** to save

<Info>
**Note**: Removing a team from a service will also remove all people assignments for that team on that service.
</Info>

## Service Details View

Each service shows important information:

- **Service Name** - The name of the service
- **Date and Time** - When the service occurs
- **Location** - Where the service takes place
- **Teams** - Which teams are involved
- **Assignments** - Who is scheduled for each position

## Best Practices

1. **Edit early** - Make changes to services well in advance
2. **Check availability** - Review availability before finalizing assignments
3. **Communicate changes** - Notify affected team members when service details change
4. **Review before deleting** - Double-check that you want to delete a service before confirming
