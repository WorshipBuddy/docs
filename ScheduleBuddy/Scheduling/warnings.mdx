When scheduling, you may notice a user highlighted red or yellow. 

When a user is highlighted red, that means there is a conflict with the user you have scheduled. It may be that they are already scheduled on the same team or they may be scheduled on a different team.

When a user is highlighted yellow, that means they have indicated that they are unavailable that day.

If you are unsure why the user is highlighted a color, you can hover over the user and a tooltip will explain the reason.
