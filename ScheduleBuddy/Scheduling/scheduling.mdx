# Scheduling Services
There are several ways to schedule users to services in ScheduleBuddy. Choose the method that works best for your workflow.

## Scheduling Methods

### 1. Bulk Scheduling (Recommended for Multiple Services)

Bulk scheduling allows you to schedule people across multiple services at once, with automatic saving.

**Steps:**
1. Go to the **Services** page
2. Click **"Schedule Team Members"** button
3. You'll see three services at a time in a grid layout
4. Use the arrow buttons (← →) to navigate between groups of services
5. For each service and team:
   - Select users from the dropdown for each position
   - Changes are **automatically saved** as you make them
6. Continue navigating through services until all are scheduled

<Info>
**Tip**: Bulk scheduling is great when you're scheduling many services at once. The auto-save feature means you don't need to remember to save each service.
</Info>

**Bulk Scheduling Features:**
- Auto-save functionality
- See multiple services side-by-side
- Easy navigation between service groups
- Color-coded warnings for conflicts and unavailability

### 2. Service-Specific Scheduling

Schedule people for a single service at a time with more detailed control.

**Steps:**
1. Go to the **Services** page
2. Click on the specific service card you want to schedule
3. A detailed popup will appear
4. For each team in the service:
   - Expand the team section
   - Select users from dropdowns for each position
5. Click **"Update Service"** to save your changes

<Warning>
**Note**: Unlike bulk scheduling, service-specific scheduling does NOT auto-save. You must click "Update Service" to save your changes.
</Warning>

**When to Use Service-Specific:**
- Scheduling a single service
- Making detailed adjustments to one service
- Reviewing and updating existing assignments

### 3. Auto-Scheduling

Let ScheduleBuddy automatically assign people based on availability and positions. See the [Auto-Scheduling documentation](/ScheduleBuddy/Scheduling/auto-scheduling) for details.

## Understanding Scheduling Warnings

When scheduling, you may see color-coded indicators in the selection dropdowns:

- **Red highlighting** - User has a conflict (already scheduled elsewhere on the same date)
- **Yellow highlighting** - User has marked this date as unavailable
- **Blue highlighting (Fatigue)** - User has been scheduled frequently recently (light to dark blue indicates increasing fatigue levels)
- **Hover for details** - Hover over highlighted names to see the specific reason

<Info>
**Tip**: Always check warnings, but remember they're informational. You can still schedule someone even if they're highlighted (for example, if the conflict is acceptable or fatigue is acceptable for that person).
</Info>

## Viewing Availability While Scheduling

Availability information is shown directly in the selection area when scheduling:

- When you open a dropdown to select a person for a position, you'll see:
  - **Available** - People who can serve (no highlighting)
  - **Unavailable** - Highlighted in yellow if they've marked this date as unavailable
  - **Fatigue** - Highlighted in blue shades (light to dark) if they've been scheduled frequently recently
  - **Conflicts** - Highlighted in red if they have scheduling conflicts

- The status text next to each person's name indicates their availability state
- People are automatically sorted with available people first, then by fatigue level, then unavailable, then conflicts

<Info>
**Tip**: You can see availability directly in the selection dropdowns - no need for a separate view. This makes it easy to choose who to schedule while seeing their availability status at a glance.
</Info>

## Scheduling Best Practices

1. **Check availability first** - Use the availability view to see who's free
2. **Balance workloads** - Try to distribute assignments fairly across team members
3. **Respect unavailability** - Only schedule people on unavailable dates if absolutely necessary
4. **Communicate** - Let people know when they're scheduled, especially for new assignments
5. **Review conflicts** - Pay attention to warnings and resolve conflicts when possible
6. **Use bulk scheduling for efficiency** - When scheduling many services, bulk scheduling saves time

## Editing Existing Assignments

To change who's scheduled for a service:

1. Open the service using either bulk scheduling or service-specific scheduling
2. Change the selections in the dropdown menus
3. Save your changes (auto-save for bulk, "Update Service" for service-specific)

## Removing Assignments

To remove someone from a service:

1. Open the service for scheduling
2. For the position where they're assigned, select an empty option or "-" from the dropdown
3. Save your changes
