# Scheduling Services
There are two ways to schedule users to services. 
- Bulk scheduling by pressing "Schedule Team Members"
- By clicking on a specific service

Below are the steps for either option:

## Bulk Scheduling
1. Go to the "Services" page
2. Press on "Schedule Team Members". Here you'll see three services at a time. You can go to the next group of three by pressing the arrows on either side.
3. For each team, select users to schedule; changes are saved automatically

You can schedule all your services from this page and it will auto save all your changes.

## Service Specific
1. Go to the "Services" page
2. Select the specific service you would like to edit
3. For each team, select the users you'd like to schedule. This **does not** auto save
4. Press "Update Service"
