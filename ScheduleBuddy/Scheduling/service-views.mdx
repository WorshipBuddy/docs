# Service View Modes

The Services page offers two different ways to view your services: **Card View** and **Calendar View**. You can switch between them to see your services in the format that works best for you.

## Card View

Card View displays services as individual cards in a grid layout. This is great for:

- Quickly seeing service details
- Comparing multiple services side-by-side
- Easy access to service actions

### Card View Features

Each service card shows:
- **Service Name**
- **Date and Time** (start and end)
- **Location**
- **Teams** assigned to the service
- **Status indicators** (upcoming, past, next upcoming)

Cards are organized:
- **Upcoming services** at the top
- **Past services** (dimmed) at the bottom
- The **next upcoming service** is highlighted with a green border

### Switching to Card View

1. Go to the Services page
2. Click the **"Card View"** button in the view toggle area
3. Services will display as cards

## Calendar View

Calendar View shows services on a traditional calendar. This is great for:

- Seeing services in chronological order
- Understanding service frequency
- Visualizing service patterns over time

### Calendar View Options

You can view the calendar in three different timeframes:

#### Month View
- Shows an entire month at a time
- See all services for the month in one view
- Navigate between months using Previous/Next buttons

#### Week View
- Shows one week at a time
- More detailed view of services within a week
- Navigate between weeks

#### Day View
- Shows a single day in detail
- See all services happening on that specific day
- Navigate between days

### Calendar Navigation

In calendar view, you can:
- Use **← Prev** and **Next →** buttons to navigate
- Click **"Today"** to jump to the current date
- Switch between Month, Week, and Day views using the view buttons

### Switching to Calendar View

1. Go to the Services page
2. Click the **"Calendar View"** button in the view toggle area
3. Select your preferred timeframe (Month, Week, or Day)
4. Services will display on the calendar

## Service Status Indicators

Both views show service status:

- **Upcoming Services** - Normal display, highlighted if it's the next upcoming service
- **Past Services** - Dimmed/faded to show they've already occurred
- **Next Upcoming Service** - Highlighted with a green border in card view

## Interacting with Services

In both views, you can:

- **Click a service** to view/edit details (if you have permission)
- **See service details** (name, time, location, teams)
- **Access service actions** (edit, delete, schedule, etc.)

## Choosing the Right View

Use **Card View** when:
- You want to see detailed information about specific services
- You're managing a small number of services
- You prefer a list-like format

Use **Calendar View** when:
- You want to see services in chronological context
- You're planning over longer time periods
- You prefer a traditional calendar layout
- You want to see service frequency patterns
