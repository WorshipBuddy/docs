### Using the Scheduler

- Check color warnings before assigning people:
  - Avoid red (conflicts) unless you intentionally want to override
  - Consider yellow (unavailable) - respect people's unavailability
  - Use blue (fatigue) as a guide - it's informational, not a hard limit
- Use pull-to-refresh to see the latest changes from other schedulers
- Swipe between services to quickly schedule multiple services

### Managing Teams

- Set clear assignment rules when creating teams
- Use descriptions to explain team purpose and requirements
- Consider position quantities carefully - these determine how many people are needed

### Managing People

- Use search to quickly find people when managing large organizations
- Check person details to understand their service participation patterns
- Review analytics to identify scheduling trends and potential issues
