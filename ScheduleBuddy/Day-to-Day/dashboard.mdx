# Dashboard Overview

The Dashboard is your personal homepage when you log into ScheduleBuddy. It provides an overview of your upcoming services, allows you to manage your availability, and gives you quick access to important information about your organization.

## What You'll See

When you open the Dashboard, you'll see:

1. **Welcome Header** - A personalized greeting with your organization's name
2. **Availability Button** - Quick access to set your availability/unavailability
3. **Upcoming Services Widget** - A list of services where you're scheduled
4. **Upcoming Events Widget** - A list of upcoming events in your organization (if you're an admin)
5. **Statistics** (Owner/Admin only) - Overview statistics about your organization

## Setting Your Availability

One of the most important features on the Dashboard is managing when you're available or unavailable.

### Opening the Availability Calendar

1. On the Dashboard, click the **"Schedule Your Availability"** button
2. A calendar popup will appear showing a full calendar view

### Marking Dates as Unavailable

1. In the calendar popup, click on any date to mark it as unavailable
2. Dates you mark as unavailable will show with a **red circle** indicator
3. Click the same date again to remove the unavailability mark
4. Your changes are automatically saved

<Info>
**Tip**: Marking dates as unavailable helps schedulers know when you cannot be assigned to services. They'll see warnings when trying to schedule you on unavailable dates.
