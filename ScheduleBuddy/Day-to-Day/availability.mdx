# Availability Management

Managing your availability helps schedulers know when you can and cannot be assigned to services. This prevents conflicts and makes the scheduling process smoother for everyone.

## What is Availability?

In ScheduleBuddy, availability is managed by marking dates when you are **unavailable**. Dates you don't mark are considered available. This approach makes it easier to mark occasional unavailability rather than marking every available date.

## Setting Your Unavailability

### From the Dashboard

1. Go to your **Dashboard**
2. Click the **"Schedule Your Availability"** button
3. A calendar popup will appear
4. Click on any date to mark it as unavailable
5. Dates marked as unavailable will show with a **red circle** indicator
6. Click the same date again to remove the unavailability mark
7. Your changes are saved automatically

### From the Services Page

When viewing a specific service, you may also see availability information if you're a scheduler or admin.

## How Schedulers See Your Availability

When schedulers try to assign you to a service:

- If you're available, your name appears normally
- If you're unavailable, your name appears highlighted in **yellow**
- They can hover over your name to see why it's highlighted
- A tooltip will indicate that you're unavailable on that date

<Info>
**Tip**: Marking unavailability in advance helps schedulers plan better and avoids last-minute conflicts.

## Best Practices

1. **Mark dates early** - Set your unavailability as soon as you know about conflicts
2. **Be specific** - Only mark dates when you truly cannot serve
3. **Update regularly** - Remove unavailability marks if your plans change
4. **Check before marking** - Make sure you're not already scheduled before marking a date unavailable

## Viewing Your Current Unavailability

To see which dates you've marked as unavailable:

1. Open the availability calendar (Dashboard → "Schedule Your Availability")
2. Dates with red circles are your unavailable dates
3. You can click any red circle to remove it and make that date available again

## Availability and Service Scheduling

Your availability directly affects scheduling:

- Schedulers are warned if they try to assign you to a service on an unavailable date
- You can still be assigned on unavailable dates (the system shows a warning, but doesn't prevent it)
- This allows for flexibility when necessary, while still informing schedulers of potential issues

<Warning>
**Important**: Even if you mark a date as unavailable, you may still be assigned to a service on that date. Always communicate with your schedulers about important conflicts.
