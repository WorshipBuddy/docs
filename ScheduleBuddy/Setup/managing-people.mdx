To remove someone from your organization:

3. Click the **"Remove from Organization"** or **"Delete"** button
4. Confirm the removal

<Warning>
**Warning**: Removing someone from the organization will:
- Remove all their assignments from services
- Remove their team permissions
- Remove them from all groups
- They will need to be re-invited to join again

Make sure you want to permanently remove them before confirming.
</Warning>

## Viewing Assignments

In the person detail view, you can see:
- Which positions they're assigned to
- Which teams they're part of
- What permissions they have on each team
- Their role (Owner, Admin, Team Admin, Scheduler, or Member)

## User Roles

Each person has a role that determines their access level:

- **Owner** - Full access to the organization (only one per organization)
- **Organization Admin** - Almost full access (can't transfer ownership)
- **Team Admin** - Can manage specific teams
- **Scheduler** - Can schedule people for their teams
- **Member** - Basic access, can view their own schedule

See the Permissions documentation for detailed information about each role.

## Relationship Tracking

ScheduleBuddy can track relationships between people (family members, etc.). This feature may be available in the person detail view depending on your organization's configuration.

## Best Practices

1. **Keep information current** - Update email addresses and names if they change
2. **Review permissions regularly** - Ensure people have appropriate access levels
3. **Verify positions** - Check that people are assigned to correct positions
4. **Communicate changes** - Notify people when you change their permissions or remove them
