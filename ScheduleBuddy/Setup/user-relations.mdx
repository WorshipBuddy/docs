## Adding a Relationship

To add a relationship between two users:

1. Go to **People** → Find the person you want to add a relationship to
2. Open their profile or detail view
3. Find the **Relations** or **Family** section
4. Click **"+ Add Relation"** or **"Add Family Member"**
5. Select the related person by their email address
6. Choose the relationship type (how this person is related to them)
7. Click **"Save"** or **"Add Relation"**

### Example

If John (john@example.com) wants to add his wife Jane (jane@example.com):
1. Go to John's profile
2. Click "+ Add Relation"
3. Enter Jane's email: jane@example.com
4. Select relationship type: "wife"
5. Save

The system will automatically:
- Add Jane as John's wife
- Add John as Jane's husband (reciprocal relationship)

## Reciprocal Relationships

ScheduleBuddy automatically creates reciprocal relationships when you add a relation:

- When you add "John is Jane's husband", the system automatically adds "Jane is John's wife"
- When you add "Alice is Bob's mother", the system automatically adds "Bob is Alice's child"
- When you add "Charlie is Dave's brother", the system automatically adds "Dave is Charlie's sibling"

<Info>
**Note**: Reciprocal relationships are created automatically using a mapping system. The system determines the appropriate reciprocal type based on the relationship you specify.
</Info>

### Reciprocal Mapping

The system uses a mapping to determine reciprocal relationships:

| Your Relation | Their Reciprocal Relation |
|--------------|---------------------------|
| husband | wife |
| wife | husband |
| spouse | spouse |
| father/mother/parent | child |
| son/daughter/child | parent |
| brother/sister/sibling | sibling |
| grandfather/grandmother/grandparent | grandchild |
| grandson/granddaughter/grandchild | grandparent |
| aunt/uncle | niece/nephew |
| niece/nephew | aunt/uncle |
| cousin | cousin |
| father-in-law/mother-in-law | son-in-law/daughter-in-law |
| son-in-law/daughter-in-law | father-in-law/mother-in-law |
| brother-in-law/sister-in-law | brother-in-law/sister-in-law |

## Viewing Relationships

Relationships appear in user profiles. To view relationships:

1. Go to **People**
2. Find and open a person's profile
3. Look for the **Relations** or **Family** section
4. You'll see:
   - List of all their relationships
   - Related person's name and email
   - Relationship type
   - Links to view related person's profile

### Relationship Display

Relationships are displayed showing:
- **Related Person** - Name and email of the related person
- **Relationship Type** - How they're related (e.g., "Wife", "Child", "Sibling")
- **Profile Link** - Link to view the related person's profile

## Removing a Relationship

To remove a relationship:

1. Go to the person's profile
2. Find the **Relations** or **Family** section
3. Find the relationship you want to remove
4. Click the delete/remove icon or **"Remove Relation"**
5. Confirm the removal

<Info>
**Note**: When you remove a relationship, the reciprocal relationship is also automatically removed. For example, if you remove "John is Jane's husband", the system also removes "Jane is John's wife".

## Requirements

To add a relationship:
- Both users must exist in the organization
- Both users must be in the same organization
- You must have permission to edit user information
- You cannot add a relationship to yourself

## Use Cases

User relations are useful for:

1. **Family Coordination** - Track family members for scheduling and coordination
2. **Communication** - Send messages to families or groups of related people
3. **Scheduling** - Consider family relationships when creating schedules
4. **Records** - Maintain accurate organizational records
5. **Permissions** - Use relationships for permission and access control (if configured)

## Best Practices

1. **Be consistent** - Use the same relationship types consistently (e.g., always use "spouse" or always use "husband"/"wife")
2. **Use specific types** - Use specific relationship types (e.g., "mother" instead of "parent") when possible for clarity
3. **Verify emails** - Ensure email addresses are correct before adding relationships
4. **Review regularly** - Periodically review relationships to keep them accurate
5. **Remove outdated relations** - Remove relationships when they're no longer applicable
6. **Document changes** - Keep records of relationship changes if needed for your organization

## Troubleshooting

**Can't add relationship:**
- Verify both users exist in the organization
- Check that both users are in the same organization
- Ensure you have permission to edit user information
- Verify email addresses are correct

**Reciprocal relationship not created:**
- The system automatically creates reciprocal relationships
- If you don't see a reciprocal, check the related person's profile
- Verify the relationship was saved successfully

**Relationship already exists:**
- Each user can only have one relationship entry with another user
- To change a relationship type, remove the existing relationship first, then add it again with the new type

**Can't find relationship section:**
- Not all organizations may have this feature enabled
- Check with your organization owner or admin
- The feature may be available in person detail views depending on your organization's configuration

**Wrong relationship type:**
- Remove the incorrect relationship
- Add it again with the correct relationship type
