   - **Duration** - Set how long the plan runs (e.g., 365 days, 1 year)
   - **End Date** - Set a specific end date
5. Set **Reading Frequency**:
   - How many times per day/week/month members will read
   - For example: "1 Per Day" means one reading session per day
6. Click **"Create Plan"**

The plan will automatically schedule all Bible chapters across the timeline you specified.

## Viewing Plans

All created plans appear in the "Organization Reading Plans" section. Each plan card shows:

- **Plan Name**
- **Start and End Dates**
- **Reading Frequency** (e.g., "1 time per day")
- **Organization Progress** - Overall progress bar showing how many chapters have been completed across all members

## Plan Actions

For each plan, you can:

- **View Details** - See the full reading schedule, dates, and chapters
- **View Organization Progress** - See individual member progress and overall completion
- **Edit Plan** - Modify plan settings (coming soon)
- **Delete Plan** - Remove the plan (cannot be undone)

<Warning>
**Warning**: Deleting a plan removes it for all organization members. Members will no longer be able to access it in the BibleBuddy app.
</Warning>

## Tracking Progress

### Organization Progress

The organization progress bar shows:
- Total chapters completed across all members
- Overall completion percentage
- Number of active users participating

### Individual Member Progress

To see individual progress:

1. Click **"Organization Progress"** on a plan
2. You'll see a list of organization members
3. For each member, you can see:
   - How many chapters they've completed
   - Their completion percentage
   - Their progress bar
4. Members who haven't joined BibleBuddy will show "Not signed into BibleBuddy" with an invite option

<Info>
**Note**: Progress is tracked when members use the BibleBuddy app. They must join the plan in the app and mark chapters as complete for progress to appear here.
</Info>

## Best Practices

1. **Plan ahead** - Create plans well in advance so members can join before the start date
2. **Use clear names** - Name plans descriptively (e.g., "2025 Year-Long Plan", "Advent Reading Plan")
3. **Set realistic frequencies** - Consider how much reading members can realistically complete
4. **Share plans early** - Let members know about new plans so they can join in the BibleBuddy app
5. **Monitor progress** - Check organization progress periodically to encourage participation

## Troubleshooting

**Can't see BibleBuddy in navigation:**
- Check that you're an Owner, Admin, or have been granted individual/team access
- Ask your organization's Owner or Admin to grant you access

**Plans not appearing in BibleBuddy app:**
- Make sure the plan has been created successfully
- Members need to be part of your organization in BibleBuddy to see organization plans
- Plans may take a few moments to sync to the BibleBuddy app

**Can't create or edit plans:**
- Check your access level - you may only have "View Only" access
- Only Owners, Admins, or users with "Edit" access can create/modify plans

**Progress not updating:**
- Members must use the BibleBuddy app to track their reading
- Progress updates when members mark chapters as complete in the app
- There may be a slight delay before progress appears here
