# Understanding Services
A service is a single meeting, like a single Sunday service or Bible study. You can create multiple services, and they will be ordered chronologically. Here you can create schedules and export them as Excel or Word files.

# Creating Services
To create a service, follow the below instructions:

1. Press the "Services" button in the top bar
2. Press the "Create Service" button on the left
3. Here, you can fill out all the information for your service:
    1. Service Name: The name of the service. An example can be Sunday Service

        2. Repeat every X week(s) on: This only applies when “Weekly” is selected as the recurrence pattern. How often the weekly recurrence happens (e.g., every 1 week, every 2 weeks).
        3. Days of the week: Check the days of the week the service will be happening.
        4. End After: End After X occurrences (Max 16 weeks).
