# Music Albums

Music albums allow you to organize audio files from cloud storage (Google Drive, Dropbox, OneDrive, SoundCloud) into collections that appear in WorshipBuddy's playlist screen for audio playback.

## Overview

Music albums are part of the WorshipBuddy integration and allow you to:
- **Create Albums** - Create collections of audio files
- **Connect Cloud Storage** - Link albums to Google Drive, Dropbox, OneDrive, or SoundCloud folders
- **Explore Folders** - Browse folder structures to find audio files
- **Add Items** - Add files or folders to albums
- **Live Sync** - Optionally sync folders so new files automatically appear
- **Reorder Albums** - Control the order albums appear in WorshipBuddy

## Creating an Album

1. Go to **Settings** → **WorshipBuddy** section
2. Find the **"Org Music Albums"** section
3. Click **"+ Create Album"**
4. Enter an album name (e.g., "Sunday Service Music", "Special Event Music")
5. Optionally add a cover image URL (must be from Google Drive, and the file must be named exactly "Album Cover" in PNG format)
6. Click **"Save Album"**

The album is created and appears in your albums list. Initially, the album will be empty until you add files or folders.

## Connecting Cloud Storage

Albums can connect to various cloud storage services:

### Supported Services

- **Google Drive** - Public Google Drive folders
- **Dropbox** - Dropbox shared folders
- **OneDrive** - OneDrive shared folders
- **SoundCloud** - SoundCloud playlists or tracks

### Google Drive Integration

To connect a Google Drive folder:

1. In Google Drive, create or select a folder containing audio files
2. Right-click the folder and select **"Share"**
3. Set sharing to **"Anyone with the link"** (must be public)
4. Copy the folder URL
5. In ScheduleBuddy, open the album you want to add files to
6. Use the file explorer (see File Explorer section below) to browse the folder
7. Drag and drop files or folders onto the album

<Warning>
**Important**: Google Drive folders must be set to "Anyone with the link" for the explorer to access them. Private folders will not work.
</Warning>

### Adding a Folder URL

When creating an album, you can optionally provide a folder URL:
1. Create the album
2. Edit the album
3. Add the folder URL
4. Set the source type (google-drive, dropbox, onedrive, soundcloud)
5. Save the album

The folder URL allows the album to reference a specific cloud storage location.

## File Explorer

The file explorer lets you browse cloud storage folders to find audio files.

### Using the File Explorer

1. In the WorshipBuddy settings page, find the file explorer section
2. Paste a **public Google Drive folder URL** (or other supported service URL)
3. Click **"Explore"** to load folder contents
4. You'll see:
   - Folders (clickable to navigate into)
   - Audio files (with file names and types)
5. Navigate into folders by clicking on them
6. Use breadcrumb navigation to go back
7. Drag files or folders from the explorer onto albums

### Supported Audio Formats

Audio files are identified by their file extensions. Supported formats include:
- MP3 (.mp3)
- M4A (.m4a)
- WAV (.wav)
- OGG (.ogg)
- FLAC (.flac)
- AAC (.aac)
- WMA (.wma)

Only audio files will be playable in WorshipBuddy. Other file types are ignored.

### Folder Navigation

- Click on a folder to navigate into it
- Use breadcrumb navigation (shown at the top) to go back to parent folders
- The explorer shows both folders and files in the current directory

## Adding Items to Albums

You can add individual files or entire folders to albums.

### Adding a File

1. Use the file explorer to browse to the file you want
2. Drag the file from the explorer onto the album card
3. The file is added to the album

### Adding a Folder

1. Use the file explorer to browse to the folder you want
2. Drag the folder from the explorer onto the album card
3. You'll be asked two options:
   - **Live Sync** - If enabled, new audio files added to the folder will automatically appear in the album
   - **Flatten** - If the folder contains nested folders, choose whether to flatten the structure
     - If flattened, all audio files from nested folders are added at the album level
     - If not flattened, the folder structure is preserved
4. Confirm the addition

### Live Sync

Live sync keeps your album synchronized with the cloud storage folder:
- When enabled, new audio files added to the folder automatically appear in the album
- The system periodically checks the folder for new files
- Existing files remain in the album even if removed from the folder (unless manually removed)

<Info>
**Tip**: Use live sync for active folders where you regularly add new music. For static collections, you can disable live sync and manually add files.
</Info>

### Flatten Option

When adding a folder:
- **Flatten = True** (default): All audio files from nested folders are added to the album at the top level
- **Flatten = False**: The folder structure is preserved, showing nested folders within the album

## Album Management

### Editing an Album

1. Find the album in the albums list
2. Click the edit icon (pencil) on the album card
3. Update the album name or cover image URL
4. Click **"Save Album"** to save changes

### Deleting an Album

1. Find the album in the albums list
2. Click the delete icon (trash) on the album card
3. Confirm the deletion

<Warning>
**Warning**: Deleting an album removes it from WorshipBuddy. The audio files in cloud storage are not deleted - only the album reference is removed.
</Warning>

### Reordering Albums

To change the order albums appear in WorshipBuddy:

1. In the albums list, drag and drop albums to reorder them
2. Or use a reorder function if available
3. The order you set here determines the order albums appear in WorshipBuddy

Albums are ordered using an `order` field - lower numbers appear first.

### Viewing Album Contents

To see what files are in an album:
1. Click on the album card
2. View the list of files and folders
3. See:
   - File names
   - Source URLs
   - Whether items are live-synced
   - When items were added

## Album Access Control

Album access is controlled through WorshipBuddy access control settings:
- **Owner/Admin Access** - Owners and Organization Admins always have access
- **Team-Based Access** - Teams can be granted access
- **Individual Access** - Individual users can be granted access
- **Access Levels** - "View Only" or "Edit" access

See the [WorshipBuddy Integration](/ScheduleBuddy/Setup/worshipbuddy-integration) documentation for details on access control.

## How Albums Appear in WorshipBuddy

Once you've created albums and added audio files:

1. Albums appear in WorshipBuddy's playlist screen
2. Audio files can be played directly from WorshipBuddy
3. Albums are accessible to organization members based on your access control settings
4. The order of albums matches the order set in ScheduleBuddy

<Info>
**Note**: Albums are shared with your organization members who are signed into WorshipBuddy. They need access to the ScheduleBuddy org to see the albums in WorshipBuddy from the org.
</Info>

## Best Practices

1. **Use public folders** - Make sure cloud storage folders are set to "Anyone with the link"
2. **Organize by purpose** - Create separate albums for different types of music (e.g., "Sunday Service Music", "Special Events")
3. **Use descriptive names** - Name albums clearly so they're easy to find in WorshipBuddy
4. **Enable live sync for active folders** - If you regularly add new files to a folder, enable live sync so they automatically appear
5. **Test playback** - Verify audio files play correctly in WorshipBuddy before events
6. **Keep files organized** - Maintain organized folder structures in cloud storage
7. **Monitor storage limits** - Be aware of cloud storage limits and quotas
8. **Backup important albums** - Keep backups of critical audio files
9. **Use consistent naming** - Name files consistently for easier management
10. **Review access regularly** - Periodically review who has access to albums

## Troubleshooting

**File explorer can't access folder:**
- Make sure the cloud storage folder is set to "Anyone with the link" (public)
- Verify the folder URL is correct
- Only public folders are currently supported
- Check that the service is supported (Google Drive, Dropbox, OneDrive, SoundCloud)

**Audio files not appearing in WorshipBuddy:**
- Verify the files are audio file types (mp3, m4a, wav, etc.)
- Check that albums have been saved successfully
- Ensure files were added to albums correctly
- Verify access control settings allow the user to see albums

**Live sync not working:**
- Live sync checks folders periodically, there may be a delay
- Verify the folder URL is still valid and accessible
- Check that new files are audio formats
- Ensure the album still has live sync enabled

**Can't add files to album:**
- Check your access level - you may only have "View Only" access
- Only Owners, Admins, or users with "Edit" access can modify albums
- Verify the file explorer can access the folder

**Album order not updating:**
- Refresh the WorshipBuddy app to see updated order
- Verify the order was saved in ScheduleBuddy
- Check that you have permission to reorder albums
