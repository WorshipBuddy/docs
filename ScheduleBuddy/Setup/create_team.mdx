# Understanding Teams

  **Warning**: Teams can not have the same name, they must be a unique name.
</Info>
3. Here, you can fill out all the information for your team:
    1. Name: The name of the team. An example can be Musicians
    2. Description: Add a brief description of what the team is. This is optional
    3. Allow assignment with other teams: If this checkbox is checked, then we will not notify you if someone is double booked on this team. For example, you would possibly check this for the cleaning team because it wouldn't coincide with the ushering team's duties.
    4. Positions:
        1. Position Name: This is the name of a position. An example would be Lead singer or Piano
        2. Quantity: This is how many of the same position you would schedule. An example is 3 back up singers, you would enter 3
        3. Allow assignment with other positions: Check this box if they are allowed to be double booked within a team. For example, a bible reader could also be playing piano the same day, you would check this box for the bible reader position.
        4. Remove: If you want to remove a position from a team
4. Press "Create Team"

You have just created a new team! You can always find and edit all your teams in the teams page. Now let's move on to creating our first service.
