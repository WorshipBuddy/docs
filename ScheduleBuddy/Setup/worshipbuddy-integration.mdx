## Troubleshooting

**Can't see WorshipBuddy in navigation:**

**Audio files not appearing in WorshipBuddy:**
- Verify the files are audio file types (mp3, m4a, wav, etc.)
- Check that albums have been saved successfully
- Ensure the songbook ID is correctly linked (if using)

**Can't edit albums:**
