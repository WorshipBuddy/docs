# User Permissions and Roles

ScheduleBuddy uses a role-based permission system to control who can do what in your organization. Understanding these roles helps you assign appropriate access levels to team members.

## Permission Levels

There are several permission levels, from highest to lowest:

1. **Owner**
2. **Organization Admin**
3. **Team Admin**
4. **Scheduler**
5. **Viewer**
6. **Member** (default, no special permissions)

## Owner

The Owner is the person who created the organization. There is only one Owner per organization.

**Can:**
- Everything an Organization Admin can do, PLUS:
- Transfer ownership to another member
- Delete the organization (if applicable)

**Cannot:**
- Remove themselves as Owner (must transfer ownership first)

<Info>
**Tip**: The Owner role should typically stay with the organization's primary administrator or leader.
</Info>

## Organization Admin

Organization Admins have almost complete access to the organization.

**Can:**
- View and edit all teams, users, services, and assignments
- Create, edit, and delete services
- Schedule anyone to any service
- Manage all teams (create, edit, delete)
- Add/remove users from the organization
- Assign team and org-level roles
- View and edit anyone's availability
- Access all settings (except ownership transfer)
- Access calendar exports
- Manage WorshipBuddy and BibleBuddy integrations (if applicable)

**Cannot:**
- Transfer organization ownership
- Delete the organization (Owner only)

<Info>
**Tip**: Organization Admins are great for trusted leaders who need broad access but shouldn't have ownership control.
</Info>

## Team Admin

Team Admins have administrative control over specific teams they're assigned to.

**Can:**
- Edit team details for their assigned teams (name, description, positions)
- Assign people to positions in their teams
- View and edit availability for their team members
- View calendar filtered to their teams
- Schedule people for their teams
- Access groups that contain their teams

**Cannot:**
- Create or delete services
- Edit teams they're not assigned to
- Add/remove users from the organization
- See or modify other teams
- Access organization settings
- Create new teams

<Info>
**Tip**: Team Admins are perfect for ministry leaders who manage specific teams but don't need organization-wide access.
</Info>

## Scheduler

Schedulers can assign people to services but have limited editing capabilities.

**Can:**
- Assign people to positions in their teams for existing services
- View their team's availability
- See services where their team is assigned
- Use the bulk scheduling interface

**Cannot:**
- Create, edit, or delete services
- Change team names or permissions
- Add/remove users
- Edit team details
- Access settings

<Info>
**Tip**: Schedulers are great for volunteers who help with scheduling but don't need to manage team structure.
</Info>

## Viewer

Viewers have read-only access to specific teams on the Services page.

**Can:**
- View the Dashboard
- View the Services page
- See services where their assigned teams are scheduled
- View team assignments (positions and who's assigned) in read-only format for their teams
- See service details (date, time, location) for services involving their teams

**Cannot:**
- Access the Teams page
- Access the People page
- Make any changes or schedule people
- Edit services or teams
- Export schedules
- Use auto-scheduling

<Info>
**Note**: Viewer permissions are useful for people who need to see information but shouldn't make changes.
</Info>

## Member (Default)

Members have basic access with no special permissions.

**Can:**
- View their personal schedule
- Set their availability
- View services they're scheduled for

**Cannot:**
- Access team management
- Schedule others
- Edit services
- Access settings

<Info>
**Note**: All users can view services they're personally scheduled for, regardless of permissions.
</Info>

## Assigning Permissions

### Organization-Level Permissions

Only Owners and Organization Admins can assign organization-level roles:

1. Go to the **People** page
2. Click on the person you want to modify
3. In the permissions section, check **"Organization Admin"** if applicable
4. Click **"Update Person"**

### Team-Level Permissions

Owners and Organization Admins can assign team permissions:

1. Go to the **People** page
2. Click on the person
3. In **Team Permissions**, select teams and assign permission levels:
   - **Admin** - Team Admin access
   - **Scheduler** - Can schedule for that team
   - **Viewer** - Read-only access
4. Click **"Update Person"**

## Permission Best Practices

1. **Principle of least privilege** - Give people only the permissions they need
2. **Start with lower permissions** - You can always increase permissions later
3. **Review regularly** - Periodically review who has what permissions
4. **Use Team Admins** - Delegate team management to Team Admins rather than making everyone Organization Admins
5. **Document permissions** - Keep track of who has what access for your records

## Permission Visibility

Navigation and features are automatically hidden or shown based on permissions:

- **Settings** - Only visible to Owners and Organization Admins
- **Teams** - Visible to Owners, Admins, Team Admins, and Schedulers
- **People** - Visible to Owners, Admins, and Team Admins
- **Groups** - Available in the system but not currently documented
- **WorshipBuddy/BibleBuddy** - Visible based on access control settings

Users will only see features they have permission to use.
