# Editing and Managing Teams

After creating a team, you can edit its details, update positions, and manage team settings.

## Editing a Team

To edit an existing team:

1. Go to the **Teams** page
2. Click on the team card you want to edit
3. A popup will appear with the team details
4. Make your changes:
   - **Team Name**
   - **Description**
   - **Allow assignment with other teams** checkbox
   - **Positions** - Add, remove, or modify positions
5. Click **"Update Team"** to save your changes

<Info>
**Note**: Only Owners, Organization Admins, and Team Admins (for their specific teams) can edit teams.
</Info>

## Managing Positions

### Adding a Position

1. Open the team for editing
2. In the Positions section, click **"Add Position"** (if available) or fill in a new position row
3. Enter:
   - **Position Name** (e.g., "Lead Singer", "Piano")
   - **Quantity** (how many people needed for this position)
   - **Allow assignment with other positions** (if applicable)
4. The position will be added when you save the team

### Editing a Position

1. Open the team for editing
2. Modify the position name, quantity, or checkbox as needed
3. Click **"Update Team"** to save changes

### Removing a Position

1. Open the team for editing
2. Find the position you want to remove
3. Click the **"Remove"** button or icon for that position
4. Click **"Update Team"** to save

<Warning>
**Warning**: Removing a position will also remove all assignments to that position in existing services. Make sure you want to do this before saving.
</Warning>

## Position Ordering

The order of positions in a team matters for how they appear in scheduling. Positions are saved in the order you add them.

<Info>
**Tip**: Put the most important or frequently used positions first for easier access during scheduling.
</Info>

## Updating Team Settings

### Team Description

You can add or update a team description to provide context about the team's purpose and responsibilities.

### Allow Assignment with Other Teams

This checkbox controls whether team members can be scheduled on other teams at the same time without warnings.

- **Checked** - No conflict warnings when scheduling team members on other teams simultaneously
- **Unchecked** - The system will warn if someone is scheduled on this team and another team at the same time

<Info>
**Example**: If you check this for "Cleaning Team", members can be scheduled for cleaning and ushering on the same day without warnings, since these don't conflict.
</Info>

## Deleting a Team

To delete a team:

1. Go to the **Teams** page
2. Open the team you want to delete
3. Click the **"Delete Team"** button (usually in the edit popup)
4. Confirm the deletion

<Warning>
**Warning**: Deleting a team cannot be undone. This will:
- Remove the team from all services
- Remove all position assignments for this team
- Remove the team from any groups

Make sure you want to permanently delete the team before confirming.
</Warning>

## Team Permissions

Team permissions determine who can edit each team:

- **Owner/Organization Admin** - Can edit all teams
- **Team Admin** - Can edit only teams where they have Admin permissions
- **Scheduler** - Cannot edit teams, only schedule people
- **Regular Members** - Cannot edit teams

## Best Practices

1. **Update descriptions** - Keep team descriptions current and helpful
2. **Review positions regularly** - Remove positions you no longer use
3. **Check before deleting** - Verify a team isn't needed before deletion
4. **Set conflict settings wisely** - Use "allow assignment with other teams" only when teams truly don't conflict
