## Understanding Schedules

A schedule is a playlist with all the songs, videos, presentations and other elements for your meeting.

# Organizing

All of your schedules are located in one place, inside the application, to make it quick and easy to organize and find your schedules. You'll see the schedules on the left side when in "Show" mode. And in the top you can see a "folder" icon, that when selected displays all of your folders and schedules. To add a folder click "New folder" at the bottom of the schedules area. You can also have folders inside folders.

        I recommend creating a main folder for each event. Then have more folders inside with the current year, if there are multiple events of the same kind each year, to keep it organized.
