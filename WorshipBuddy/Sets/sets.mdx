Sets allow you to group songs from any language—including custom songs outside the songbook—for a worship service. This gives you a seamless flow of songs, one after another, without flipping through a songbook or removing pages.

You can start a new set, join an existing one, or access sets you’ve previously saved. All sets are shareable and can be accessed by anyone you share them with.
