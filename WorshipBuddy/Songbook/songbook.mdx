When you select a song from the index, you’ll be taken to the songbook view.

In the top-right corner, you can share the lyrics (currently available for the US songbook only), listen to a recording if available, and like the song.

At the bottom, you can navigate to the next or previous song, transpose up or down using the + or – buttons, or tap the current key to quickly choose a different key from the popup.
