In the Music Library, you can explore a wide range of albums organized by language and year. Youâ€™ll also find a special album for your liked songs.

When you open an album, you can download the entire album, shuffle a random song, or start playback from the top.

The music player includes controls to shuffle, skip back, play/pause, fast forward, and repeat either a single song or the entire album.
