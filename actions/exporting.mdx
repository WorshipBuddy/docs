Access from the application menu: File -> Export. Or press CTRL/CMD + E.

These are the currently supported export options:

# Project
This will export a .project file, containing the current project list and all of the shows contents. This can be imported by PresenterBuddy on another device. Media files have to be transported manually right now.

# SHOW
Exports a standard PresenterBuddy .show file, with all the formatting included.

# TXT
Will create a text file from all the selected shows.

# PDF
Will create a PDF for each of the selected shows. Here you can tweak a lot of settings, like to only export lyrics, only slides, or both.
