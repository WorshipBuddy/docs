# PowerPoint
Clicking on "PowerPoint" and selecting a presentation will import just the text and create a new show, which is useful for importing song lyrics.

But if you want to import the presentation as it is, with all of it styles, you currently have to import the presentation as PDF. If you have PowerPoint installed you can export it as PDF inside the application, if not you can use an online "PPTX to PDF converter".

# PDF
You can import a PDF file, there is also an option to convert the PDF pages to images, this way you can add next slide timers and edit it the same as a normal show.

# Project
A PresenterBuddy project is a file containing a project and all of it shows, it's useful to easily transfer a project to another computer.

# Calendar
Import a calendar .ics file. It will be converted to the programs own calendar format, that can be accessed from the "Calendar" drawer menu. If you import the same calendar multiple times, only the new/changed events are imported.

# FAQ
The EasyWorship files did not import the correct song names

The song names in EasyWorship are stored in a seperate file than the song content, so you need to select both the SongsWords.db (song content) file & the Songs.db (song data/names) file to get the proper names.
