# How to use
When you have more than one output active you will get some buttons over the output preview on the right side, where you can click on them to toggle the active output windows, or hold CTRL/CMD to select just one. And right click any of them to show or hide individual windows.

When starting a show, or clearing layers it will only change the selected output windows.

# Specific outputs
When right clicking a slide or a textbox, you can hover over the option "Specific outputs" where you can set it to only show up in one or a few specific outputs.

# Step by step
# How to create lower third display for a live stream
Create a new template for lower third with custom item position/styling.
Go to "Outputs" in the settings, and at the bottom click "Add" to create a new output, you can rename the outputs so you have two called e.g. "Congregation" & "Stream".
Now go to "Styles" in the settings, and at the bottom click "Add" to create a new style, you can rename the styles so you have two called e.g. "Default" & "Live".
In the Live style, make the changes you need. You can apply the custom template with lower thirds, toggle visible layers, even set the lines to 2 to have max two lines, & more!
Now go back to "Outputs" and select the "Stream" output, and add the "Live" style to that!
