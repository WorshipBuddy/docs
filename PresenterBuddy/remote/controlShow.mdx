PresenterBuddy has a build in presentation controller to easily change slides or even highlight the screen.

The controller is a simple presentation controller that anyone can use to control their presentations. It even has a build in "draw" mode to hightlight certain areas of the screen. This is the same as the "Draw" page, but remotely.
