Overview of the .project format if you would like to convert something else into a PresenterBuddy project file.

A project file is a collection of many shows (songs/presentations), and can also include media files, overlays, etc.

The data type is JSON (optionally ZIP to include media files). Supported file extensions for both data types are .project or .shows (Or .json / .zip depending on the type).

A project file can be a simple .json file. But if you must include media (images/videos/audio) files, then the project_file.json must be renamed to data.json, and be added to a .zip archive along with the media files, in that case the files key as shown below, must also be added to the json format.

# JSON Format
```
{
	"project": {
		"name": "Project Name",
		"created": 0, // date in Unix time
		"modified": 0, // date in Unix time
		"parent": "/", // leave as / (root)
		"shows": [
			// a list of the different project parts
			// supported types: show (song/presentation), section (text divider), image, video, audio, overlay, pdf, ppt
			// default "type" is "show"
			// a few examples:
			{ "id": "<show_id>" }, // see "shows" down below
			{
				"id": "section_id", // must be unique
				"type": "section",
				"name": "Section Name",
				"notes": "Further details...",
				"color": "" // optional, a color value in hex
			},
			{ "id": "image_path", "type": "image", "name": "Image Name" },
			{ "id": "video_path", "type": "video", "name": "Video Name" }
		]
	},
	"shows": {
		"<show_id>": {
			// a JSON formatted SHOW object
			// a show can be a song/presentation etc. (see below)
		}
	},
	// optional, if used in a show or in the project list add them here
	"overlays": {
		"<overlay_id>": {
			// very similar to a SHOW object
			"name": "Overlay Name",
			"color": null,
			"category": null,
			"items": []
		}
	},
	// optional, this is only needed if you create a ZIP project file with media files
	// can be any path/name.ext, but the basename (name.ext) must be the same as placed in the zip file
	"files": ["image_path", "video_path"]
}
