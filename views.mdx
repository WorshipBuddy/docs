# Different views
There are different types of views for a show, the default and best for presenting is the "Grid view". They can be changed in the bottom center when a show is selected. Here is an explanation of the different show views:

# Grid view
This is the most common view. Here you can see all of the slides as they are outputted in a grid. Useful for presenting.

# Simple view
This is a trimmed down version of the grid view. All the slide icons, labels, and also any disabled slides are hidden.

# List view
All of the slides from the grid view are shows on the left in a list, and on the right you can quickly change the text of any textboxes on the slides. Useful for quick editing of typos.

# Lyrics view
This is similar to the remote lyrics view, this is all of the text in a list without any formatting. Useful if you want to sing along while presenting.##
